# peerPriceCheker
Check your peers product link to see if or not they have any updates on prices other profiles.
I am schedule to do this price checker on alibaba.com, taobao.com, 1688.com, and pinduoduo.com. Currently, I finished the checker for taobao.com and 1688.com.
For using this, you need to set the environment for python 3, requests, re, selenium 4, and chromedriver the webdriver to help you control your Google Chrome browser. You can check what I imported in the python file.
You can put the product links into the txt file called urlListTaobao.txt, one link each line. Then run the program, you need to log in your taobao account once unless taobao.com will refuse your request.
Currently, this taobao price checker are not able to check Tmall products due to the more difficult structure and I do not have that needs yet.
